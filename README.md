# Efficient and Systematic Metamorphic Testing for Vision-Based Autonomous Driving

This repository contains the implementation of the **Efficient and Systematic Metamorphic Testing Framework for Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS)**. Our framework integrates **causal inference** and **diffusion models** to improve the reliability testing of ADS, enabling the detection of faults under diverse and critical test conditions.

## Overview

This repository provides tools and methods for performing metamorphic testing on vision-based ADS. The framework includes:
- **Causal inference** to identify critical driving conditions.
- **Finetuned diffusion model** to transform source images to high-risk test cases.
- **Baselines for comparison**, such as Random/DeepTest/DeepRoad/TACTIC/CycleGAN metamorphic testing approaches.

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each serving a specific purpose in the testing pipeline. Below is a detailed description of the folder structure and key files.

## Folder Structure

- `Autopilot/`: 
  - Contains 5 implementations of the tested autonomous driving algorithms.
  - Includes the source images that are used as input for metamorphic.
  - Statistical analysis of the performance of various ADS models on a given dataset.

- `Baselines/`: 
  - Includes test images generated by the Metamorphic Testing baselines. 
  - Statistical evaluations of the quality of test images produced by the baseline method and the inconsistent behaviors observed.
  - `TACTIC/`: 
    - Implements representative metamorphic testing baselines for comparison.
    - Subfolders include:
      - `do_testing/`: Main implementations for TACTIC testing.
      - `logger/`: Logs and records of TACTIC search results.
      - `munit/`: Contains random MUNIT-based and DeepRoad-based Metamorphic Testing methods and weights.
      - `test_outputs/`: Stores mutation results generated by baseline methods.
      - `train_outputs/`: Tracks neuron coverage during the training of the tested algorithms.

- `CausalAnalysis/`: 
  - Houses structural causal models and counterfactual models.
  - Implements a multi-objective search framework to identify critical test conditions.

- `DataGenerator/`: 
  - Collecting data from CARLA to train ADS models.
  - Loading `carlaenv.xlsx` to generate randomized environments for collecting observational datasets.

- `Metamorphic/`: 
  - Applies the identified test conditions to transform source images into high-risk driving scenes using a fine-tuned diffusion model.

- `requirements.txt`: 
  - Lists all Python dependencies required to run the project.
